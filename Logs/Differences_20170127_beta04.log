GET :
 - GETHIGH returns RKIND=-1 for CCC-type files
LABEL :
 - Modify PRTLAB and PRTLAB3 so as to indicate the presence
   of ranges in time or in the vertical coordinate. This change
   impacts about 80% of the r.diag main modules

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/CDF2CCC *

RDLATLON2 : 
 - Save the time bounds value in HIVAL and LOVAL in highbuf when the
   sample size can be specified via the "-dt" command-line argument.
   The time bounds are then saved in IP2/IP3. Otherwise, HIVAL-LOVAL
   is saved in IP2. In all cases, the DATEO/DATEV values correspond
   to the first and last samples used in the time-mean calculations
GET_ATTRIBUT/PUT_ATTRIBUT :
 - Consider NF_INT data
