Description of the changes that have been made to r.diag since April 17 2017

* DEVELOPMENT *

Commandes :
 - Add the explicit requirement of the netcdff package.
 - Remove comments relating to AIX.
README.md :
 - Add more details as to how the netcdff library is acquired.
Makefile :
 - Acquire the netcdff SSM package in the 'initial' target.
 - Remove the EXTRAS directory and libraries for the recipies.
 - The NetCDF converter dependencies are also simplified.

* DEVELOPMENT/INCLUDE *

cdf2ccc :
 - Re-define the default 'udunit_def' fully
   qualified initialisation path.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/CDF2CCC *

Makefile :
 - Same issues as for the DEVELOPMENT Makefile.
 - Use s.ftn in the final link step. This permits the 
   definition of an appropriate rpath variable as
   retreived via a 'nf-config --runpath' command.
 - Remove the AIX target.
lire_arg :
 - Build udunits2_def from three udunits2_def1/2/3 substrings.
 - Enforce stricter limits to the '-dtsize' parameter.
 - Use the get_environment_variable intrinsic command to
   determine the UDUNITS2_XML_PATH environment variable
   value. If defined, its value overides that of the
   default udunits2_def variable.
rdlatlon2 :
 - Use the '-dtsize' argument instead of '-dt' when 
   attempting to restore the descriptors associated
   with time-mean variables in CMC-RPN files.
