Description of the changes that have been make to r.diag since January 27 2017

* DEVELOPMENT *

Commandes :
 - Add crc32.o to the list of fixes. This file is being provided by
   Michel Valin to eliminate a linker collision between libz and RMNLIB.
   This is a temporary fix until RMNLIB can be corrected.
Makefile :
 - Generate the cdf2ccc/cdf2rpn binaries with the netcdf4 and udunits2
   libraries as well as Michel Valin's f_udunits_2.f90 FORTRAN to C wrapper.
   This also implies explicitely using the hdf5, dl, z and expat libraries.
   The converter no longer calls udunits functions directly but only calls
   the interface routines found in f_udunits_2.f90. The wrapper object
   code is also inserted into the new static udunits2 library.
README.md :
 - Account for the NetCDF and UdUnits developments presented above.

* DEVELOPMENT/INCLUDE *

CDF2CCC.H :
 - Account for the new default udunits2 XML initialisation
   file name that is saved in the udunit_def variable.
 - Remove the BOOT logical variable.

* DEVELOPMENT/LIB *

CRC32.C :
 - Added to eliminate a linker collision between libz and RMNLIB.
   Again, this is a temporary fix until RMNLIB can be corrected.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSPGM *

GGSTAT/INVNTRY :
 - Increase the size of the retrun buffer
   for PRTLAB3 from 72 to 100 characters.
TIMAVG :
 - Replace calls to GETMSET3/PUTMSET3 by calls to GETMSET4/PUTMSET4,
   accounting for their new calling sequences (extra arguments).

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSSUB *

GET :
 - Restore the pre-20161110 version of GETMSET3.
 - Rename the new version to GETMSET4, again to 
   account for its new calling sequence
PUT :
 - Restore the pre-20161110 version of PUTMSET3.
 - Rename the new version to PUTMSET4, again to 
   account for its new calling sequence

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/CDF2CCC *

CDF2CCC :
 - Modify the internal documentation to reflect the use of
   the UDUNITS v2 library, namely the "UDUNITS2_XML_PATH"
   environment variable which should point to the
   udunits2.xml internal configuration file.
DECODATE, ENCODATE, ENLEVE_BISSEXTILE2  :
 - The .ftn versions are replaced by .f versions, as the
   udunits.inc that needed to be pre-processed in order to
   define the UD_POINTER as INTEGER*8 is no longer used
 - All UDUNITS2-related calls are now done by udparse3.
INITALISE :
 - Remove initalisation of the boot variable from the block data section
LIRE_ARG :
 - Modify the -udunits argument documentation to reflect the
   path of the new udunits2.xml initialisation file.
 - Modify the udunits environmewnt variable which is now called
   "UDUNITS2_XML_PATH". This should reflect the full path name
   of the udunits2.xml file to be used at execution time. Please
   note that the default is to use the file saved at the same
   time as the UDUNITS2 library was generated.
Makefile :
 - Add the udunits2, hdf5_hl, hdf5, dl and z libraries
   and remove the reference to the udunits library.
 - Add support for files with .f90 extensions.
 - The RMNLIB macro points to rmn_015.2 and UDUNITS macro
   points to the "udunits2 expat" pair of libraries.
 - Remove all references to decodate.ftn, encodate.ftn,
   enleve_bisesextile.ftn, udparse.ftn and uduerr.ftn.
 - Add relevant references to udparse.f90.
RDLATLON2 :
 - Correction to the decode_single_level subroutine
   to account for values >= 1.0.
UDPARSE :
 - The .ftn version is replaced by a .f90 version that now
   handles both the actual encoding and decoding of the
   Gregorian calendar dates.
 - The main routine name is changed to UDPARSE3 to
   account for the routine's expanded calling sequence.
 - The new interface to the UDUNITS2 library is handled
   via a use statement of the f_udunit2_f module.
 - The UD_PARSE_ERROR routine is added. It is called by
   udparse3 to print relevant UDUNITS2 error messages.
UDUERR :
 - This routine is now obsolete and has been removed.
