Description of the changes that have been made to r.diag since March 02 2017

* DEVELOPMENT *

README.md :
 - Correction for ECCC (rather than EC) and add more
   details as to the dependance on the NetCDF versions.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSPGM *

FSTMDIAG :
 - Use the RP3%kind return value and the CORRECT_OK status
   value from the call to diag_decode_ip to decide wether
   the new IP1/2/3 coding has been detected. This coding
   allows for vertical or time intervals. A time interval
   will in turn be recognized as a strong indication
   of a previous time mean operation.
TIMAVG :
 - Insure that the accumulator Input stream uses a different
   I/O buffer (JBUF) than the Input samples (IBUF). This corrects
   an incorrect IPM definition and an thus an error -13 exit.
VEINT, VPINT, VPINTL and VSINT :
 - Output actual vertical range in IP1/IP3.
 - Some F90 cleanup.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSSUB *

CONVSUB :
 - Same correction as for FSTMDIAG above but in IBUFILL.
   This change only has an incidence in TIMAVG at this time.
DIAG_CONVERT_IP123 :
 - A IP1=0 instance will generate a CONVERT_OK status in decode_ip.
DIAG_CONVIP_PLUS :
 - Check for CONVERT_OK in DECODE_RANGE.
GET :
 - Trim a few GETMSET4 DEBUG messages.
 - Correct a few GETSIZ4 DEBUG messages.
PUT :
 - Do not treat IP1 in PUTSAMPLZ as
   it it irrelevant at this point.
