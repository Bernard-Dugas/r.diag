Description of the changes that have been make to r.diag since December 14 2016

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/CDF2CCC *

INQ_FILE :
 - Use GETSAMPLZ to define the time-mean sample
   sizes (IP3) rather that retreiving them directly
   from the IP3 in the high IBUF section
RDLALON2 : 
 - Use PUTSAMPLZ to save the time-mean sample
   sizes (SVSM) rather that simply writing them
   to IP3 in the high IBUF section

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSPGM *

FSTMDIAG :
 - Remove argument -oldip3. The code will now determine
   wether this condition appies on the fly.
 - Limit the possible npas,deet modifications to account for a
   "deet > 16777215" situation to a maximum of two iterations.
FSTTRI :
 - Add a "PARJOUR" or "BYDAY" optional value to the -split argument.
   Output files are then written for separate days and their names are
   in a *_YYYMMDD format. This is a user-requested modification.
 - Write the accessory records (>>,^^,!!,HY) to these "split" files
   as well as to the *_renvois output file.
 - More extensive error checking of function return codes.
T2TEST :
 - 64-Bits I/O mode.
 - Major syntax updates F77 --> F90.
 - Use GETSAMPLZ to determine the sample sizes for CMC/RPN files.
TIMAVG :
 - Reproduce the support of the new IP1/2/3 coding implemented in
   FSTMDIAG, but still accounting for the extra limitations that
   come with TIMAVG with respect to FSTMDIAG. One of these limitations
   implies that sample and average data cannot be mixed in the same
   file. These changes are mainly implemented via modified calls to
   the GETMSET3/PUTMSET3 subroutine and a new call to GETIPMODE.
 - Simplify the DATE-TIME-STAMP calculations. As part of this, all
   calls to DATMGP2 and JDATEC were removed/replaced.
TIMCOV :
 - Major syntax updates F77 --> F90.
 - Correction for debug-mode calls to STDEV.
 - Again, reproduce the support of the new IP1/2/3 coding implemented
   in FSTMDIAG, but still accounting for the even greater limitations
   that come with TIMCOV with respect to FSTMDIAG. The sample sizes
   for CMC/RPN files are determined via a call to GETSAMPLZ.
 - And again, simplify the DATE-TIME-STAMP calculations. As part
   of this, all calls to DATMGP2 and JDATEC were removed/replaced.
TTESTA,TTESTE :
 - Syntax updates F77 --> F90.
 - Use GETSAMPLZ to determine the sample sizes for CMC/RPN files.
VBASD :
 - 64-Bits I/O mode.
 - Use GETSAMPLZ to determine the sample sizes for CMC/RPN files.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSSUB *

CONVSUB :
 - Add to WRITSTD the same code that attempts to correct
   a possible "deet > 16777215" situation in FSTMDIAG. This
   comes with a new error exit code (-4) in that routine.
GET :
 - Modify calls to GETSAMPLZ in GETMSET3 (extra argument).
 - Add GETIPMODE function (new or old IP1/2/3 coding ?).
 - Account for a possible "deet > 16777215" modified npas,deet
   pair in GETSAMPLZ. This was already done in FSTMDIAG.
 - In general, make sure that GETSAMPLZ supports the same
   coding options for the average record descriptors as
   found in FSTMDIAG.
LSSUB :
 - Document (via the command-line) the -4 WRITSTD error exit code.
PUT :
 - Again, make sure that PUTSAMPLZ supports the same coding
   options for the time-average record descriptors as in FSTMDIAG.
UTIL :
 - Premptive removal of any left-over $TMPDIR/zcrochets files
   at program startup in JCLPNT. The presence of this file is
   a signal that an older version of r.diag was called rencently. 
   This 'zcrochets' file in incompatible with the current version.

* DEVELOPMENT/MAN/PDOC *

Error_messages :
 - Document (via html) the -4 WRITSTD error exit code.
