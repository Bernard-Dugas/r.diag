Description of the changes that have been made to r.diag since May 03 2017

* DEVELOPMENT *

Commandes, README.md :
 - Replace the .so SSM netcdff package by the static netcdff-4.4 package.
Makefile :
 - Document the previous modification.
 - Add the 'web_documentation' target and re-activate the
   HOSTWEB/DIAGWEB macros giving them the 'pascal' and
  'public_html' values (i.e. people.sca.uqam.ca/~dugas).
 - Split the 'initial' target into the 'initial_base'
   and 'initial_cdf' targets.

* DEVELOPMENT/BIN *

command-origin-document.sh :
 - Add this script to modify the old RCS $HEADER character
   string that is found in the LSPGM modules to something
   more appropriate. Something that can actually be
   inferred from the current state of the git archive.
   The .txt documention files in the man/pdoc directory
   are modified by this procedure rather than the
   source files themselves.

* DEVELOPMENT/INCLUDE *

CDF2CCC, DIMMEM, SPECMEM, VARMEM, WORKMEM, ZTYPMEM :
 - Code changes for F77and F90 compatibility.

* DEVELOPMENT/MAN/PDOC *

Makefile :
 - Account the replacement ofcdf2ccc.ftn by cdf2ccc.F90.
 - Re-activate the HOSTWEB/DIAGWEB macros.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/CDF2CCC *

To account for the explicit treatment of the
 'taille_entete' pre-processor macro by FORTRAN 90:
  CDF2CCC.FTN is replaced by CDF2CCC.F90 and
  DEF_DIM_COORD.F is replaced by DEF_DIM_COORD.F90 and
  GET_TOPO.F is replaced by GET_TOPO.F90 and
  INQ_FILE.F is replaced by INQ_FILE.F90 and
  VERS_CCCMA.F is replaced by VERS_CCCMA.F90 and
  VERS_NETCDF.F is replaced by VERS_NETCDF.F90.
RDLATLON2 :
 - Inititialize the GRILLE_Z and GRILLE_Y variables (BUGFIX).

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSPGM *

FSTTRI :
 - Better document the 'PARJOUR'/'BYDAY' -split options.

 - The documentation .txt targets now call the new
   command-origin-document.sh script to modify the old
   RCS $HEADER to something more appropriate.
