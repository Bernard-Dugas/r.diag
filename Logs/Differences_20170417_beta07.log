Description of the changes that have been made to r.diag since March 21 2017

* DEVELOPMENT *

Commandes :
 - Use the vgriddesc-5.6 library while generating
   the executables. At this time, this is the latest
   version and it includes support for VKIND=5005.
README.md :
 - More explicit wording as to the actual Vgrid Descriptor
   package to be used, as well as more comments concerning
   the FORTRAN code.


* DEVELOPMENT/INCLUDE *

TOC_GEST_1, TOC_GEST_2 :
 - Add support for VKIND=5005.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/CDF2CCC *

ATTRIBUT_COORD, INQ_FILE :
 - Add support for VKIND=5003,5004,5005.
 - Add an error exit in INQ_FILE if a Ying/Yang GEM4
   'U' grid is detected (XIT -13). This is not yet
   supported.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSPGM *

GSAPL :
 - Change the declaration of the LOG_PRESSURE argument
   to GEM4APL. It is no longer a FORTRAN pointer.
GPASG :
 - Expand the documentation section that describes what
   are the actual supported GEM4 VKIND values, depending
   on the program's various operating modes.

* DEVELOPMENT/SRC/LSSUB *

COORD, DIAG_CONVIP_PLUS :
 - Add support for VKIND=5005.
DIAG_TOC :
 - Add support for VKIND=5005, including the option to
   retreive the DHT and DHM diagnostic heights.
 - Modify all calls to VGD_GET to fix a problem (that
   occured under PGI) with character constants.
GEMDIAG :
 - Correct both the SIG declarations and the
   calls to LOPTOC in GEM4APL and PLAGEM4.
 - Change the LOG_PRESSURE argument declaration.
   The LOPTOC corresponding argument is now a
   local pointer variable.
